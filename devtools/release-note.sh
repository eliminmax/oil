This is the latest version of Oil, a Unix shell that's our upgrade path from
[bash][]:

[bash]: \$xref

<div class="attention">

[Oil version $OIL_VERSION][release-index] - Source tarballs and documentation.

</div>

To build and run it, follow the instructions in [INSTALL.txt][].  The wiki has
tips on [How To Test OSH](\$wiki).

If you're new to the project, see [Why Create a New Shell?][why-oil] and posts
tagged #[FAQ](\$blog-tag).

[release-index]: /release/$OIL_VERSION/

I'm trying something different this release.  These release notes are
semi-automated with a shell script!  See the [last

## Appendix: Metrics for the $OIL_VERSION Release

These metrics help me keep track of the project.  Let's compare this release
with the previous one, version [$metric_prev](/release/$metric_prev).

### Spec Tests

The spec test suites for both OSH and Oil continue to expand and turn green.

[spec-test]: \$xref:spec-test

- [OSH spec tests for $metric_prev](https://www.oilshell.org/release/$metric_prev/test/spec.wwz/survey/osh.html): **1994** tests, 
**1771** passing, **86** failing
- [OSH spec tests for $OIL_VERSION](https://www.oilshell.org/release/$OIL_VERSION/test/spec.wwz/survey/osh.html): **2008** tests, **1783** passing, **87** failing

---

- [Oil spec tests for $metric_prev](https://www.oilshell.org/release/$metric_prev/test/spec.wwz/oil-language/oil.html): **404** tests, **375** passing, **29** failing
- [Oil spec tests for $OIL_VERSION](https://www.oilshell.org/release/$OIL_VERSION/test/spec.wwz/oil-language/oil.html): **419** tests, **391** passing, **28** failing

### Source Code Size

Despite the new features, the code is still compact.  Significant lines:

- [cloc for $metric_prev](https://www.oilshell.org/release/$metric_prev/pub/metrics.wwz/line-counts/osh-cloc.txt):
  **19,318** lines of Python and C, **346** lines of ASDL
- [cloc for $OIL_VERSION](https://www.oilshell.org/release/$OIL_VERSION/pub/metrics.wwz/line-counts/osh-cloc.txt):
  **19,408** lines of Python and C, **346** lines of ASDL

Physical lines:

- [overview for $metric_prev](https://www.oilshell.org/release/$metric_prev/pub/metrics.wwz/line-counts/overview.html):
  **36,899** in OSH and common libraries, **4,843** in Oil
- [overview for $OIL_VERSION](https://www.oilshell.org/release/$OIL_VERSION/pub/metrics.wwz/line-counts/overview.html):
  **37,095** in OSH and common libraries, **4,871** in Oil


### Benchmarks

The [oil-native](\$xref) Parser performance hasn't changed:

- [Parser Performance for $metric_prev](https://www.oilshell.org/release/$metric_prev/benchmarks.wwz/osh-parser/): **8.7**
  thousand irefs per line
- [Parser Performance for $OIL_VERSION](https://www.oilshell.org/release/$OIL_VERSION/benchmarks.wwz/osh-parser/): **8.7**
  thousand irefs per line

Runtime performance for the Python / "[OVM](\$xref)" build:

- [Runtime Performance for $metric_prev](https://www.oilshell.org/release/$metric_prev/benchmarks.wwz/osh-runtime/): **88.7** and **48.5** seconds running CPython's \`configure\`
- [Runtime Performance for $OIL_VERSION](https://www.oilshell.org/release/$OIL_VERSION/benchmarks.wwz/osh-runtime/):
  **92.1** and **70.6** seconds running CPython's \`configure\`

### Native Code Metrics

I didn't work on the translation during this release, but we're not regressing:

- [OSH C++ spec tests for $metric_prev](https://www.oilshell.org/release/$metric_prev/test/spec.wwz/cpp/osh-summary.html): **1777** tests, **1627** pass in Python, **1487** pass in C++
- [OSH C++ spec tests for $OIL_VERSION](https://www.oilshell.org/release/$OIL_VERSION/test/spec.wwz/cpp/osh-summary.html): **1786** tests, **1637** pass in Python, **1495** pass in C++.

The following deltas are proportional.  Generated source lines;

- [oil-cpp for $metric_prev](https://www.oilshell.org/release/$metric_prev/pub/metrics.wwz/line-counts/oil-cpp.txt): **93,239** lines of C++
- [oil-cpp for $OIL_VERSION](https://www.oilshell.org/release/$OIL_VERSION/pub/metrics.wwz/line-counts/oil-cpp.txt): **93,566** lines of C++

Binary size:

- [ovm-build for $metric_prev](https://www.oilshell.org/release/$metric_prev/benchmarks.wwz/ovm-build/):
  **1,376,608** bytes of native code (under GCC)
- [ovm-build for $OIL_VERSION](https://www.oilshell.org/release/$OIL_VERSION/benchmarks.wwz/ovm-build/):
  **1,388,960** bytes of native code (under GCC)
